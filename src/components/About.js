      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      Hi, I'm Emma Johnson—a detail-oriented and motivated front-end developer passionate about creating engaging and intuitive web experiences. With a strong foundation in the MERN stack and hands-on experience in building dynamic applications, I bring both technical expertise and a collaborative spirit to every project. My transition into web development is backed by a Professional Certificate in Coding from MIT xPRO, where I honed my skills in React, API integration, and responsive design. I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Psychological Sciences from the University of Connecticut, which has equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
      </p>
      <p>Beyond coding, I’m a lifelong learner who thrives on exploring new hobbies and crafts. From restoring antique furniture to building intricate models, I love diving into creative projects that challenge me to think differently. Whether it’s tackling a DIY project or mastering a new technique, I’m always eager to pick up new skills and expand my horizons.
      </p>
      <p>I’m excited to bring my passion for learning, creativity, and technical skills to a front-end development role where I can build impactful, user-friendly applications.
